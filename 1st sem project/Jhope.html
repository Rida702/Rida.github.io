<h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early life and Education </h2>
<p style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jung Hosoek was born on February 18, 1994, in Gwangju,, South Korea. His family consists of his mother, father and older sister.

     Before debuting with BTS, he was part of the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;underground dance team Neuron and took dance classes at Gwangju Music Academy for six years, from 4th grade to his 1st year in high school, when he signed his contract with &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big Hit Entertainment. His skills in dance eventually led him to gain interest in singing, helping him to audition as an idol trainee. As a trainee, J-Hope was featured as a rapper in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jo Kwon's song "Animal", which was released in 2012.</p>
    <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Artistry </h2>
    <p style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J-Hope has been described as having an upbeat and energetic tone to his music and performances. His mixtape, Hope World, was described as having a fun nature and variety  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of musical genres, including synth-pop, trap, house, alternative hip hop, funk-soul, and retro elements. In a review published by The 405, Emmad Usmani praised the mixtape's &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concept  and production, writing "J-Hope showcases exceptional creativity, genuine personality, and a cohesive sense of direction over the 20 minutes of the project". J-Hope cites &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the adventurous nature of Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and the works of Kyle, Aminé, and Joey Badass as influencers on his style and work on Hope World. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of peace has also provided a basis for much of his lyrics, stating that "it'd be fantastic to become a part of someone's personal peace through my music" in an interview  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with Time magazine.</p>
