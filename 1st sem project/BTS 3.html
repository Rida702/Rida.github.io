<p style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am just so happy and amazed at all these new ARMYS joining our fandom! It's great that BTS are gaining so much popularity and I see it on the chats and on YouTube that tons &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of people, especially after the BBMA's are starting to realise actually how good they are. As someone who's been there from the very beginning since they first debuted it's weird &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seeing all this international popularity, but it's also amazing. I feel like a proud mother watching her kids go off to college. You want them to have fun and grow up but it's still so hard &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to see them go and fly the nest.

He's also taught me to persevere and that it's okay if some people don't like you because there will be a thousand other people who love you. He taught &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me to be confident and comical and also to be loyal like when the rest of BTS tested him by getting the manager to ask him if he wanted to go solo and he said no.

He taught me to be the mum friend &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to always support my loved ones. He also taught me to love how I look unconditionally because that's more important than other people loving how you look.

He taught me to be confident in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myself and he is my inspiration for getting over my depression anxiety because he himself was in a dark place and he survived. He is also my music inspiration as he is so talented. He &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is strong and modest and he taught me to always keep going as there is always light at the end.

He taught me to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pursue my personal dreams and also that sacrifice and generosity are amazing things, just like how he agreed to train as a rapper because Taehyung wanted to be a vocalist.

I know he has had self esteem issues and body issues and some people have &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;told him he needs to diet but through all this he has taught me I don't need to meet everyone's expectations of me, I only need to be what I want to be and I only need to satisfy &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myself. He has taught me to stay above the haters and still be gracious.

He has taught me to be happy and kind and respectful &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of those around me just like he is to he hyungs. He has taught me to stay grounded and also not to forget how education is important. The fact that he managed to be a K-pop star &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and graduate highschool with really good grades is amazing.

He has taught me so much. He is my inspiration. He has taught me don't be afraid to be weird and over the top and excitable all the time &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as those who love you will accept you. He has taught me to be respectful to both young and old and he has taught me it's okay to be a child at heart. He had taught me how &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;important family is and that they shouldn't be taken for granted. He has also taught me it's okay to show your emotions to the people you love and care about, like how he stood up &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in front of thousands of people and talked about his grandma. He has taught me to be joyful in even the most horrible situations and he has taught me to be gracious with my talents. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taehyung has taught me that it doesn't matter where you come from you can still be amazing if you work for it, and that is exactly what he did he worked for it.

<h1>About this Project:</h1>
<p style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project is made by a team of four people. BTS made a very strong impact on our lives. They told us how to be creative and just be ourselves and most importantly, how to love &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ourselves. They changed our way of thinking and made us courageous and strong. That's why we chose this topic for our semester's project. Every person  worked hard for this &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;project and everyone worked equally.</p>
