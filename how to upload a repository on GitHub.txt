To make a Git repository: 

1. git config --global user.name
2. git config --global user.email "bcsf20m541@pucit.edu.pk"
3. git config --global user.name Rida702
4. touch .gitignore
	.git ignore is an optional filr
	you make it and then put the name of the file inside it that you want to ignore
	it is done when a file size is too big and u don't want to add it in your repository
5. git init
	that will initialize your git and make a .git folder
6. git add .
	-------> means add all the content to the staging area
7. git commit -m "initial commit"
	whenever u do commit u take a snap shot of it
	git add and git commit kar k jo changes kie use aik snapshot se associate kar dete ho
	initial commit because haven't change anything yet
8. git status
	On branch master
	nothing to commit, working tree clean
	means you are ready to publish your project
9. Create a New repository in Github and Click on SSH copy the link
10. git remote add origin git@github.com:Rida702/Blog-Website.git
	it means all the contents of this project will go at this link of github
11. git push origin master 
	this command will fail because u are uploading a private repository
	so you have to make an authentication
12. generate SSH key
13. ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "bcsf20m541@pucit.edu.pk"
	command not fount

	Your public key has been saved in /c/Users/abu musa traders/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
	this is path of my key
15. tail, cat /c/Users/abu musa traders/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
it will get the whole ssh key
